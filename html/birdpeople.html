<h1>Bird People</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Bird People are a reoccurring species of humanoid alien birds in Rick and Morty that are a direct parody of the Tangata Manu people from the Buck Rogers series. The most prominent of the bird people is Birdperson, a close friend of Rick's, who was, along with him, apart of a team of rebels who fought against the Galactic Federation, and a major supporting character in the series, who has received plenty of critical acclaim from fans.</p>

<p>Their home world was introduced in the episode, Get Schwifty. It was an organic planet that according to Birdperson, mainly relies on farming, and other ethical forms of survival. It also has plenty of technology, and a stable, calm, peaceful environment from what has been seen of it so far. It is likely that it will make a reappearance in later seasons.</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p>Bird People live in wooden structures often incorporated into trees, but do possess technology like TV. They primarily eats worms and have worm ranches around on the planet. When sending messages they tend to use robotic eggs with hologram messages. In Bird culture, mate-melding is the equivalent of marriage on Earth.</p>
