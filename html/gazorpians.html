<h1>Gazorpians</h1>

<h3>Behaviour</h3>

<p>Male gazorpians have an incredibly primitive behaviour. They only care about destruction, asserting their dominance and procreation. They do not wear any clothes or speak a developed language, but they do understand english to a certain degree. They are naturally instilled on death and destruction from birth. They will attempt to mate with any female they find, regardless of race.</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p>The male gazorpians live on the surface of their planet where they fight each other and mate with the sex robots when they are released out onto the planet. They presumably do not have a central leader.</p>

<p>The female gazorpians have their own city under the planet's surface, where they have a modern society with shops and restaurants. They live a male-hating lifestyle due to the development of their own species; what they know of the universe states that matriarchal societies are, by far, less common than "yet another" patriarchal societies, like Earth. Even though they seem to have "freed" themselves from a male-oriented society, they still hold on to the idea that bodily sounds from women are taboo and not to be heard of.</p>

<p>Females are capable of reason, however. After Summer pointed out that her well-liked and fashionable top was designed by a gay man, she explained that it is not appropriate for Gazorpian female laws to be applied to humans or Earth standards.</p>
